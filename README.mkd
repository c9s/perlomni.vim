Install
========

perl-completion.vim comes with some depended vim scripts (libperl.vim and
search-window.vim) and perl-completion.vim is using PPI (pure perl parser) to
parse perl syntax to make completions.

the util scripts will be installed to ~/.vim/bin/ , so please add ~/.vim/bin/
to your $PATH env variable.  add this to your .bashrc or .zshrc:

    export PATH=~/.vim/bin/:$PATH

under the perl-completion.vim directory there is a META file, which noted the
version and dependencies.  VIM::Packager is for solving dependency problem.
please install VIM::Packager first:

    $ sudo cpan VIM::Packager

and the perl code parsing stuff needs PPI:

    $ sudo cpan PPI

then we use vim-packager script to generate Makefile:

    $ vim-packager build

then install:

    $ make install

to enable perl-completion.vim omni completion, you have to enable your filetype
plugin on. pre-append those settings to your `.vimrc`:

    filetype on
    filetype plugin on
    filetype indent on

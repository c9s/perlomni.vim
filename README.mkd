Install
========

perl-completion.vim comes with some depended vim scripts (libperl.vim and search-window.vim)
and perl-completion.vim is using PPI (pure perl parser) to parse perl syntax to make completions.

the util scripts will be installed to ~/.vim/bin/ , so please add ~/.vim/bin/ to your $PATH env variable.
add this to your .bashrc or .zshrc:

    export PATH=~/.vim/bin/:$PATH

under the perl-completion.vim directory there is a META file, which noted the version and dependencies.
VIM::Packager is for solving dependency problem. please install VIM::Packager first:

    $ sudo cpan VIM::Packager

then we use vim-packager script to generate Makefile:

    $ vim-packager build

then install:

    $ make install
